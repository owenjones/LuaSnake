There's no way to natively create a zip file from the command line on Windows
so I'm afraid you're going to have to do it yourself..

Open the folder "luasnake" and select all the contents, right click and 
"Send To" > "Compressed (zipped) Folder"

Name this zip file "luasnake.love" and double click it to run the game.
